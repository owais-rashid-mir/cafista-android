    <!-- Name for the Order summary. It'll be shown in the format of Name : Owais where Owais
     is the user's name. [CHAR LIMIT = NONE] .
     xliff : This will be used for the strings that will change. For e.g, what name the
     user enters during ordering, that name will be shown. So, this Name changes every time and
     can be anything. For these types of strings , we use xliff.
     For using xliff, we need to add this at the top under the 'resources' tag:
     xmlns:xliff="urn:oasis:names:tc:xliff:document:1.2"
     -->
<string name="order_summary_name"> Name : <xliff:g id="name" example="Owais"> %s </xliff:g> </string>

</resources>
